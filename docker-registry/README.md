# Docker Registry: Vagrant VM #

This box provisions a Virtualbox VM containing two things
* a Docker Registry.
* a Docker Host (daemon).

**Warning!** This is an insecure registry for *development use and POCs only.*

## Prerequisites (Windows)

Windows 7 or 10 x64, with at least 4 GB RAM, and:

1. Vagrant 1.8.6 or higher.
1. Virtualbox 5.0 or higher.
1. Hardware Virtualization enabled in BIOS.

*This registry will not get provisioned in a Virtualized Environment. Use [docker-provider/Vagrantfile](docker-provider/Vagrantfile) instead.*

## How to run

In a terminal, execute the following:
1. `git clone` this repository.
1. `cd` to this directory.
1. Execute `vagrant up`.

### What does this do?

1. Creates a Virtualbox VM (based on Ubuntu 14)
1. Installs Docker and creates a Docker Registry
1. Opens up ports as needed

## Registry Info

Registry URL:

```
84.84.87.88:5000
```

Registry UI:

Load the following in a browser:

```
http://84.84.87.88:9090
```

## Notes

### Testing that registry works

Push an image to this registry.

```
# pull an image from the Docker Hub.
docker pull hello-world:latest

# retag it.
docker tag hello-world 84.84.87.88:5000/hello-world

# Push it to your local Docker Registry
docker push 84.84.87.88:5000/hello-world
```

Then query the registry to verify that it exists.

```
vagrant@ubuntu-14:~$ curl -X GET http://84.84.87.88:5000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["hello-world"]}
```


### Interacting with the registry

*Get the list of images in this Docker Registry:*

```
curl -X GET http://84.84.87.88:5000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":[]}
```

### Connecting to this registry
If you want to pull images from this registry, your Docker Daemon will need to be modified.

#### From Ubuntu 14.04 and Docker Engine

On Ubuntu 14.04, the following additional parameter needs to be added to `/etc/default/docker`.

```
# Use DOCKER_OPTS to modify the daemon startup options$DOCKER_OPTS
DOCKER_OPTS="$DOCKER_OPTS --insecure-registry 84.84.87.88:5000 --registry-mirror=http://84.84.87.88:5000"
```

This points the Docker daemon to use the registry in insecure mode.

**Note**: On Docker 1.12 at least, the options are easy to get wrong!
* `--insecure-registry` seems to work only with a bare IP and *no `=` sign.*
* `--registry-mirror` seems to *require* the `=` sign and an `http://`.

#### From Windows x64 and Docker Toolbox


```
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox --engine-insecure-registry 84.84.87.88:5000 --eng
ine-registry-mirror=http://84.84.87.88:5000 docker-registry-client

eval $(docker-machine env docker-registry-client)
```
